# Processes In Linux

A process is an instance of a running program. Every time you execute a command or run a program, the Linux kernel creates a process to run it.

## Key Properties Of A Process

| Property                 | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PID (Process ID)         | Unique identifier for every process                           |
| PPID (Parent Process ID) | Unique identifier of the process that created the PID process |
| UID (User ID)            | Who owns the process                                          |
| State                    | Running, sleeping, zombie etc....                             |
| Memory Info              | RAM consumption                                               |
| Executable code and data | What itâ€™s running and working with                            |

## Process Hierarchy

Processes follow a tree like structure in linux.
  - The first process is `init` or `systemd`, depending on the system, which is started by the kernel. It's PID is 1, and PPID is 0.
  - Every process is created by another process (its parent process).
  - Every process is a decendent of the `init` process.

To view the tree like structure of the processes, use `pstree`

Why does process hierarchy exists? To understand this, we need to understand how processes are created.

## Process Creation

It is a 4 step process.

| Step | Description                                           | Function |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1    | Clone the current process                             | `fork()` |
| 2    | Replaces the process image with the new program       | `exec()` |
| 3    | Parent waits for the child to finish                  | `wait()` |
| 4    | Process finishes and returns the status to the parent | `exit()` |

Each process may require other helper processes.
  - For example, when I did `pstree`, I found that VS Code is not a standalone process. It has a lot of subprocesses in itself.
  - The same is with firefox and other processes.

Hirarchial structure is not just a design philosophy, but a very logical decision.
  - It is a proper way to manage which process spawned which subprocess.

Now the question is, how can this be done?
  - The child process must have the identifying attributes from the parent process. This is the requirement.
  - The most straightforward way to do this is to make a clone of parent process, keep the metadata attributes the same and change the process-specific attributes accordingly.
  - And this is what the above mentioned 4-step process is doing.

## Let's Go Practical

We are going to run an ELF binary made up of this C code:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>

void main(){
  printf("Hello, World!");
  sleep(400);
}
```
and see how linux do all the magic.

To get the final ELF binary:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main_exe
```

Check:
```bash
file main_exe

main_exe: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

### Step1 - Call The Binary

To call or execute the binary (`main_exe`), we need a shell (or terminal).

Now I have opened my shell, which is zsh.
```zsh
$ which zsh

/usr/bin/zsh
```

`zsh` itself is a "running" process. Lets find out.
```zsh
$ ps
  
PID TTY          TIME CMD
41027 pts/0    00:00:01 zsh
49852 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```
This shows that zsh has a process ID of 41027.

Now I ran the binary.
```zsh
./main_exe
```

Lets do ps again. But the shell is occupied now. Lets run this binary in background.
```zsh
$ ./main_exe

[1] 52184
```

We can also verify the process IDs again.
```zsh
$ ps                

PID TTY          TIME CMD
41027 pts/0    00:00:02 zsh
52184 pts/0    00:00:00 main_exe
52325 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
```

Since ./main_exe is executed within zsh, zsh must be the parent of main_exe? Lets verify this.
```zsh
$ ps -T -o pid,ppid,cmd

PID       PPID      CMD
41027     40797     /usr/bin/zsh -i
59461     41027     ./main_exe
59559     41027     ps -T -o pid,ppid,cmd
```
  + -T shows processes for the current terminal session.
  + -o helps in custom formatting.
  + But this shows that main_exe is a child of zsh.

This proves that `fork()` was called upon the `zsh` process.
  - Now, `execve()` is called inside this child process

### Step2 - `execve()`

execve is a syscall, which replaces the current process image.

A fork is a new-clone of the parent process. But the child has a differnt task than the parent. Therefore, the process image has to be changed in order to reflect that.
  - This is what `execve()` is purposed for.

The kernel opens `main_exe` ELF file using virtual file system (VFS).
  - Now it reads the ELF Header (first 64 bytes) to confirm that it is an ELF file, and find the `e_type`, `e_entry` and Program Headers Table (PHT) for the later work.

The kernel loads the binary into memory by reading PHT. This is the PHT for our ELF:
```bash
$ readelf -l main_exe

Elf file type is DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)
Entry point 0x1060
There are 14 program headers, starting at offset 64

PHT describes how the operating system should load the ELF binary into memory. It essentially maps parts of the binary file into memory regions with specific permissions and purposes.

A simple decode of this cryptic table is:
  - Type: PHDR
    ```
    Offset:  0x40
    VirtAddr:0x40
    Size:    0x310
    Flags:   R
    ```
    This describes where in memory the program headers themselves are located.

    The loader reads this to get all other segment info.

  - Type: INTERP
    ```
    Offset: 0x394
    VirtAddr: 0x394
    Size: 0x1c
    Flags: R
    [Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2]
    ```
    Specifies the dynamic linker to load and run this PIE executable.

    This linker will resolve symbols and apply relocations before main() runs.

  - Type: LOAD Segments, The actual loadable code/data in the binary
    ```bash
    # LOAD 1
    Offset: 0x0
    VirtAddr: 0x0
    FileSiz: 0x660
    Flags: R
    ```
    The R flag shows that this is a read only section, contains the initial part of ELF.

    ```bash
    # LOAD 2
    Offset: 0x1000
    VirtAddr: 0x1000
    Size:    0x179
    Flags:   R E
    ```
    This is a read + executable section. This implies that it contains the actual code segment

    ```bash
    # LOAD 3
    Offset: 0x2000
    VirtAddr: 0x2000
    Size:    0x10c
    Flags:   R
    ```
    Another readonly segment, which may contain constants and other ro-data.

    ```bash
    # LOAD 4
    Offset: 0x2dd0
    VirtAddr: 0x3dd0
    Size: File=0x250, Mem=0x258
    Flags: RW
    ```
    This section is both readable and writeable. This is where .data, .bss, etc.... are stored.

  - Type: DYNAMIC
    ```bash
    Offset: 0x2de0
    VirtAddr: 0x3de0
    Size: 0x1e0
    Flags: RW
    ```
    Contains relocations, library names, symbol tables, etc...., which are used by the dynamic linker to perform symbol resolution and relocation at runtime.
  
  - Type: Note Segments and GNU_PROPERTY, for metadata handling. Nothing explosive.
  - Type: GNU_EH_FRAME, exception handling frame, used by debuggers and during crashes.
  - Type: GNU_STACK, specifies stack permissions.
  - Type GNU_RELRO, a region that is read-only after relocation.

The kernel finds the `LOAD` segments and maps them into memory.

Now our program's memory is loaded, but we're not executing yet.

### Step 3 -
